As a result, LCAPs can accelerate the development processes and reduce time to market. In addition, low-code platforms can provide governance and control over the development process, and the ability to automatically generate code that is compliant with corporate standards. This can help to reduce the risk of errors and improve the quality of the application.<br /><br />The adoption of LCAPs is accelerating across all industries as organisations demand new digital solutions in rapidly changing operational environments, where skilled developers are often in short supply.  <strong>With a well-designed & executed strategy, low-code/no-code can enable rapid scale by removing financial and resource barries</strong> which would have made many initiatives previously unviable.</p>",
